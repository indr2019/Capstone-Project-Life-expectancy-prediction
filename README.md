# Capstone-Project-Life-expectancy-prediction
The task is to train a model which predicts the life expectancy of every country based on the given indicators. It is a ‘Linear regression’ problem.
# Purpose of the project
With the help of this model we can predict the average life expectancy of a country based on attributes which relate to health and other factors which can help nations to focus on improving their Human development index (HDI).The dataset is based on research by World Health Organization (WHO) and contains indicators related to health and other factors, for 193 countries.
